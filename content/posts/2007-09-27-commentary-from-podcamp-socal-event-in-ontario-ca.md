The main difference between radio and podcast broadcasting is that the latter can be repurposed across many delivery systems: mp3 players, internet, iPhone, email; and, the potential distribution is world-wide. A common misconception is that a podcast is recorded (not live) and radio with a live presentation is more interactive and appealing to the listener. This is just not true, many podcasts are broadcast live, using the internet with call-in and live chat interaction. While the podcast will not replace TV or radio it has the added value of a more select and targeted audience. This type of focus and trust relationship between the host and listener will most likely be sought after by advertises who would like to chime-in with a message to consumers.

For businesses this may prove to be a big bang for your buck promotion tool, or another vehicle to extend their brand impression. The key is targeting a niche market, many business will likely become a podcast advertiser in the not-so-far future. Also, business may find a creative way to provide value to their clients using this form of audio and visual broadcast over the internet. With tight or empty advertising budgets, many companies may begin to publish a promotion series on podcast and even distribute their message on an MP3 player or video iPod.
