Here is my situation, I am working on an eCommerce site with over 4,000 unique
visitors each month but the checkout rate seems fairly low, and the analytics
show a large percentage of potential customers exiting the checkout process at
the confirm stage. Also, a large volume of visitors landing on the home page
bounce without entering in to key areas of the site and responding to my calls
to action (buying product or completing a form).

**The major shift for me will be creating a larger return on investment for my search engine optimization and marketing efforts by creating a larger percentage of goal conversions with my current volume of web site traffic.**

This will have a lasting and recurring benefit since a small decrease in
bounces and abandoned goal funnels will generate a higher percentage of growth
without buying more traffic. This process of conversion optimization has the
biggest band for my buck (or sweat) and helps with growing conversions with my
current pay-per-click campaigns. Also, the strategies presented will help me
communicate more effectively with my audience. The book inspired me to apply a
conversion optimization beginning at my check-put pages, working my way back
to the home page. After adding a secondary goal on my detail pages I noticed
an increase in online sales. This optimization process creates results!
