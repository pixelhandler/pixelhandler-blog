**Search**:

### [What is SEO process ?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/web-development/TCH_WDD/199145-17077367?browseIdx=4&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by C.R. in [Web
Development](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse/technology/web-
development/TCH_WDD?goback=%2Eama), [Graphic
Design](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse/marketing-sales/graphic-
design/MAR_GRD?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"Targeting keywords and testing your results in search engines then testing
how real people respond to your listings in search results. Success is when a
searcher is looking for just what you offer and your listings in the search
engine results page (SERPs) are relevant and the best answer to the reason
they started searching anyway. When your prospect finds you and stops
searching that is SEO at its best."

###  [As an SEO client, what kinds of stats do you track? What kinds of information would you like to be able to track?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-marketing/MAR_ADP_INM/203869-2821834?browseIdx=8&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by H.H in [Internet Marketing](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse
/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-
marketing/MAR_ADP_INM?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"SEO is a tool to reach business goals and a part of a bigger plan within an
internet marketing strategy. The important metrics would be directly related
to your business goal, creating leads or converting browsers into customers,
then turning them into repeat customers. I track the results in SERPs for my
targeted keywords and watch the analytics for the landing pages with the
appropriate calls to action to reach my goals. I also use analytics to monitor
my goal funnels."

**Ecommerce:**

###  [What % of all page views are product detail pages in ecommerce sites?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/e-commerce/TCH_ECM/204425-1612763?browseIdx=0&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by M.J. in [E-Commerce](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse/techno
logy/e-commerce/TCH_ECM?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"I just read a book titled, Web Design for ROI. The authors run an agency,
Closed Loop Marketing (CLM), and do report on ecommerce metrics. The numbers
may not be based on the top 1000, but the authors, Lance Loveday and Sandra
Niehaus, have specialized in ecommerce. I posted an audio review of the book
on my site. The metrics vary based on so many factors, I don't believe an
industry breakdown will help you. I would suggest that the home page
percentage would be more like 50% rather than 15%, and many people report on a
2-3% conversion rate. In my opinion it doesn't matter so much what the metrics
are for other sites, it matters that you know the metrics for your site and
what to do about them to improve your conversions."

###  [Which are the web sites which appear to be the most profitable (return on investment)?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/e-commerce/TCH_ECM/199214-317122?browseIdx=3&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by A.C. in [E-Commerce](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse/technolo
gy/e-commerce/TCH_ECM?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"Any web site that offers an informational product with a high dollar sale for
e-commerce transactions. For example, a real estate coaching site that offers
membership at a premium fee would be a example of a high return on investment
ROI web site."

**Social Media:**

###  [Twitter: How useful is it?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-marketing/MAR_ADP_INM/205031-8169793?browseIdx=1&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by M.S. in [Internet Marketing](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse
/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-
marketing/MAR_ADP_INM?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"I use twitter combined with my WordPress blog to show my tweets on the blog
and also to announce my posts to the Twitter audience. I've learned that
marketing folks tend to go wild with it. I think the best use of twitter would
be to have a micro conversation; however twitter often seems more like a
shoutbox. twitter may be one way to reduce those reply to all email updates
when updating a group of friends about an event or hot subject. also seems
like a shameless way to get links, traffic and hopefully some other social
bookmarking activity."

**Internet marketing:**

###  [10 Million Page Views A Month, Hardly Any Revenue](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-marketing/MAR_ADP_INM/205027-4542288?browseIdx=2&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by P.S. in [Internet Marketing](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse
/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-
marketing/MAR_ADP_INM?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"Patrick, you received a lot of great answers so far. I want to suggest
including affilitate links in your email newsletter, like ads for cell phone
wallpaper, ringtones, etc. Other affiliate links that may generate revenue
from your audience are 'free stuff' links where the visitor completes surveys
to win. This young audience has more time than money, finding a way to
monitize from their time investment in your network, or perhaps from their
opinions may help the situation."

###  [What Interview Questions Would YOU Ask a Marketing professional?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-marketing/MAR_ADP_INM/203942-3313281?browseIdx=5&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by R.H. in [Internet Marketing](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse
/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-
marketing/MAR_ADP_INM?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

" **(1)** What is your passion? **(2)** How well do you understand new media?
**(3)** What is your experience in creating ROI within my niche market?"

  * [What piece of PPC management software is the best?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-marketing/MAR_ADP_INM/122087-1202503?browseIdx=9&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by R.D. in [Internet Marketing](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse
/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-
marketing/MAR_ADP_INM?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"I am assuming that you are already using Google Analytics in combiniation
with AdWords. I use them in addition to other keyword research tools like
WordTracker.com and WebCEO."

**Business: **

###  [Help with small business start up/internet marketing?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-marketing/MAR_ADP_INM/201168-5850689?browseIdx=6&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by M.L. in [Internet Marketing](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse
/marketing-sales/advertising-promotion/internet-
marketing/MAR_ADP_INM?goback=%2Eama), [Starting
Up](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse/startups-small-businesses/starting-
up/STR_STP?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"Well, I am very impressed with the community responses to your business
problem. My experience is that jewelry sells best in person and under good
lighting conditions, people like to see it on before they buy. Video content
may be good to use personal testimonies. Also take advantage of social
networks to create more in person shows. Perhaps an affiliate program would
help with sales; other bloggers could offer your jewelry on their sites and
earn commissions."

###  [How to find good open source consultants for full time work?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/information-technology/computer-networking/TCH_ITS_CNW/201872-8886523?browseIdx=7&sik=1207550620415&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by R.R. in [Computer
Networking](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/browse/technology/information-
technology/computer-networking/TCH_ITS_CNW?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"Open source developers are community minded. Join the open source communities
that you want to find an expert in and join the conversations. Perhaps you can
find a meet up of developers at meetup.com to make connections, also posting a
classified in facebook.com may generate some interest."

### [How to deduct web development and custom software donations?](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/finance-accounting/accounting/FIN_ACC/205913-13218578?browseIdx=0&sik=1207722607048&goback=%2Eama)

_Asked by D.K. in [Accounting](/answers/browse/finance-
accounting/accounting/FIN_ACC?goback=%2Eama), [Corporate
Taxes](/answers/browse/finance-accounting/corporate-
taxes/FIN_CTX?goback=%2Eama)_

#### Answer:

"My experience is that creating websites for non-profits is a gift of labor,
although the time is money to you, the IRS doesn't consider the time
investment to your favorite charity as a monetary contribution, and not tax
deductible. I would consider limiting your time to what you can freely give
and be satisfied that you are making a difference! As a web developer I often
use opensource or free software (e.g. apache web server on linux); so at times
it makes sense to pay it forward, just don't go broke doing so."
