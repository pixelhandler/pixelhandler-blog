#### **'Bill's Internet Marketing Report' **- Another good reason for
businesses to blog

**- **_Strategies and topics relating to the happenings I experience in the race of marketing, publishing and selling on the web._

I'm currently employed by a medical equipment manufacturer and distributor (I
freelance too) and last month some very interesting news was broadcast on news
radio and the internet about the LA Laker's own Kobe Bryant and his back
injury.

> [From latimes.com -- May 13, 2008](http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-
kobeback13-2008may13,0,3003048.story)


"I tried to play and make drives to the basket where I could kind of withstand
the pain without the back completely spasming and then put the next game
really in jeopardy," Bryant said.

> On Monday he addressed reporters while standing, as he did during Sunday's
postgame news conference. Bryant said he would receive round-the-clock
treatment.

> His regimen includes ice, heat, massage and stretching. Bryant also held his
electrical stimulation device by his side, saying he would basically sleep
with it the next couple days.

The reason why this news was inspiring for my employer is that the company's
main product offering does just what Kobe's medical device does and more. This
news became a great way for the company to share with clients about just how
good their technology really is; also sharing the story about Kobe saying "he
would basically sleep with it the next couple days." In following up on the
report, Kobe did not miss a game during this series and continued to score
very well, while the Lakers moved on to the next playoff series.

The reason why this news was so valuable to blog about is that it allowed the
[company's news blog](http://www.vqorthocare.com/blog/vq-news/kobe-bryant-
electrical-stimulation-for-recovery-back-spasms/) to add valuable content
supporting the site's search engine optimizations (SEO) objectives. The
general public may use different variations of the words that a business uses
to describe its offerings. The blog format allows for a very quick response to
optimizing the companies Web site with the terms used by the general public
and reporters. The best benefit is that the reported did report on Kobe
talking about a medical condition that my employee has a solution for, back
spasms!

Once the blog was posted, the same day as multiple news agencies reported on
the injury I sent off an email to a targeted group of clients that would be
very impressed with the technology and hearing that a professional basketball
player and NBA MVP says so. That perspective was a lot better than I could
say, even though I used the technology after a broken leg and shoulder and
loved how well the medical device blocked my pain.

The return on investment for this blog and email blast was that conversation
were opened up with key clients who needed to learn more about the technology
and how it fit in within the sports profession.

#### **'Highlights in Social Media' **- Starting up an online social network
with NING

**- **_The Internet is bringing people together and making connections for personal and professional development. Being involved socially online is a way to build new relationships with like-minded individuals._

Recently I became interested in social media and networking with other like
minded Internet professionals. My favorite online social networks are
linkedin.com and twitter.com, I use facebook.com and a few others less often.
When I read about ning.com in FastCompany magazine and also heard about
ning.com again during a local meetup in OC. This got my created juices flowing
and since I enjoy networking with other professionals, and also have spent
much of my career flying solo (as an in-house person or working from home), I
was inspired to kick off a new network, [refreshoc.com](http://refreshoc.com)
in alignment with the '[Refreshing Cities](http://refreshingcities.com/)'
concept… Refresh is a community of designers and developers working to refresh
the creative, technical, and professional culture of New Media endeavors in
their areas. Promoting design,technology, usability, and standards.

I am interested to find out how many other Orange County Internet
professionals would be interested in networking and building a local community
for sharing experiences on creating the Web that we surf on. At the end of
2007 I attended a PodCamp in Ontario (SoCal); there I was very interested in
how people gather around a common interest or passion. I was able to learn
from others who are doing what I wanted to learn, just by attending and
participating in the unconference style of gathering.

One concept that I would like to discuss on Refresh OC is the possibility of
growing a community of OC Internet professionals who would like to attend a
facilitated, participant-driven gathering centered around building the
Internet; where professionals share, learn and grow in an open environment.
Perhaps this will happen once discussions begin on the topic of planning
events and organizing discussions, demos and interaction from participants
right Here in OC. Perhaps each event could have a 50/50 raffle or a more
creative way of raising funds to benefit a local cause.
