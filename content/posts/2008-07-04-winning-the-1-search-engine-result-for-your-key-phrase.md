#### **'Bill's Internet Marketing Report' **- Winning the #1 Search Engine
Result for Your Key Phrase

**- **_Strategies and topics relating to the happenings I experience in the race of marketing, publishing and selling on the web._

Having the top result on Google for your main key phrase just feels great!
Seriously, in this time of uncertainty, being number one even for a short time
is pretty cool. It is also nice when a competitor enters the market and
previously held the #1 search result which you now hold.

Search engine optimization : the search query is : [**noninvasive
neuromodulation**](http://www.vqorthocare.com)

  * We're number one! Results 1 - 10 of about 92,500 for noninvasive neuromodulation. 
  * Mid month the decision is made to update the web site with new terminology
  * Take a vacation and violá the search crawler does it's magic and the result is favorable
  * the competitor who previously ranked #1 for the search query was bumped down but still on page one of Google

Recent changes in Google's search engine results pages (SERPs) for google
account holders:

  * While logged in to google the SERPs vary based on the same search query
  * Fresh/new content ranks higher then seems to drop as newer posts assume the search query's freshness
  * Holding the #1 ranking in the SERP will required continued link building, hence this post!

#### **'Highlights in Social Media' **- Online Networks for Web Designers and
Developers

**- **_The Internet is bringing people together and making connections for personal and professional development. Being involved socially online is a way to build new relationships with like-minded individuals._

Last month I created a Ning network, at
[refreshoc.ning.com](http://refreshoc.ning.com), and as a results was invited
to join [dezumo.com](http://www.dezumo.com) ; there I joined the conversations
on web design and posted a forum topic "[What are your favorite sites for
inspiration on the topic of Web
design?](http://www.dezumo.com/forum/topic/show?id=562455%3ATopic%3A15284)"
Dezumo has about 293 members and has been around for about a year while the
RefreshOC started a month ago and only has about 18 members. Dezumo is has a
larger audience while RefreshOC is targeting a local metro area. Both were
kicked off right here in Orange County. I enjoy the conversations on dezumo
and am hoping the RefreshOC group will become more active as social networks
become more of a source for making connections locally.

On the subject of inspiration for web design I did receive a few responses
from the group, I visited the links and found some fresh sites to add to my
[del.icio.us bookmarks on the topic of
design](http://del.icio.us/pixelhandler/design) . While a couple people were
eager to share links for inspiration sake one designer posted a note to
creating new design without being tempted to follow the pack; along with this
response were no links but a tip on seeking inspiration from the world around
you. I am very fond of this concept of being inspired from life itself, but
also find it very valuable to examine successful design concepts. Design
techniques that work well should be mimicked, especially for the sake of user
experience and usability.
