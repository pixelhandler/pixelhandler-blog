At the finish of
the conference I ended up with 278 noteworthy entries (twitter hashtag:
'aea09'). I viewed the favorites on twitter and copied the ordered list
(source) into an HTML presentation (S5) template by Eric Meyer. Check out the

conversation was centered around the topic of User Experience (UX). **Update**
(5/10/09) - I_ added an iPhone CSS stylesheet to the presentation to make it
mobile friendly for Apple enthusiasts._ [![An Event Apart Twitter favorites

html and pasted into [Eric Meyer's S5 HTML
