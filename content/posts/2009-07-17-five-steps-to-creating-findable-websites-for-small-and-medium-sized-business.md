Next, I build out a demonstration
site [http://demo.overhaulindustries.com](http://demo.overhaulindustries.com/)
for previewing how to use WordPress as a business website publishing tool.
These two task formed my product offering of a templated business website ;
basically an online brochure. Second, I created a 
[brochure website guide](http://overhaulindustries.com/brochure-sites/how-to-prepare-a-brochure-website-for-your-company) on how to prepare content; my goal was to establish
a fast turnaround, with content up front or early the project can avoid being
held up for content. To speed up the process and get the business owner
engaged I added a form to capture the content online; adding a few links to
push visitors to send my their content. Third, I added a PayPal button for the
deposit/payment; this gets me engaged in delivering a site quickly. The fourth
step was to [document the process](http://overhaulindustries.com/brochure-sites/the-process-in-building-your-brochure-website) of delivering the website
project; an effort to help the client get to know how to work with me.

winning project should result in – creating free leads online; basically
generating free listings on search engine results pages. This process of
documenting the experience of designing template solutions for small brochure
website projects lead to creating marketing materials to promote sales. This
content is a result of conversations I've had repeatedly over the years; why
not use the product myself? The results was the best layout and design I've
had on my business website in years, and using the platform I enjoy,
WordPress. Being excited about this discovery, I sent out an invitation my
email to friends, family and clients; I even had a good response. I expect
that I may complete 3-4 brochure websites in the next couple weeks. I look
forward to measuring the results. So now, I'm following up with the leads
using this 5 step approach:
