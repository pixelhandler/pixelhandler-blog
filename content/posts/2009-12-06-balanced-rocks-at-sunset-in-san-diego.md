This weekend I celebrated my 10 year anniversary by taking a day trip to San Diego with my bride. 
Along the coast was a street performer showing his talent of balancing rocks. 
We happened to stroll by as the sun dipped toward the ocean and I took a quick picture with my iPhone. (© 2009, Bill Heaton)
