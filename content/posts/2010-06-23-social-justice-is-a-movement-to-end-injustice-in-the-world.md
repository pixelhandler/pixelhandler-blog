More stats: 

  * **27 million**: Number of people in modern-day slavery across the world
  * **800,000:** Number of persons trafficked across international borders each year
  * **17,500:** Number of foreign nationals who are trafficked into the U.S. every year
  * **50:** Percent of all victims are children
  * **$50 Million:** US Government budget for efforts against human trafficking
  * **218 Million:** Estimated number of children working aged between five and seventeen
  * **126 Million:** Estimated number of children who work in the worst forms of child labor - one in every twelve of the world's five to seventeen year olds.
…We live in a broken world sex trafficking even exists in OC, CA. Live for
something… with a passion to end injustice, seek out likeminded people. You
will not have wings to fly if you get overwhelmed. Try a region least likely
to be evangelized (none or only a few existing missions efforts) or where life
is very short. Just start with one cause. Find something you are passionate
about and can do something about. Because we live in an interdependent world
we cannot ignore the problems in the world… do justly, speak up!
