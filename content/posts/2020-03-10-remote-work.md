This is what I propose as a distributed (remote) workplace manifesto...

1. Results only work environment is the way of the remote worker, make that common.
2. Help everyone with meeting online, have a zoom # (video conference) in all meeting requests, have someone available on the Slack chat to reach out to be sure everyone can join, as a fallback use the dial-in phone number. Everyone can use Slack on their phones.
3. Meetings need a facilitator to be sure the agenda is on track and all voices have an opportunity to communicate, including onsite and distributed team members.
4. If it didn’t happen online, it didn’t happen. Use collaboration tools such as the Paper/Google Docs/Discourse/Notion to capture and share dialog – to provide easy access to meeting notes/agenda and take away actions.
5. Status meetings are for connecting not just status, come prepared. It’s a good idea to copy status into a Slack chat before/after the meeting - anyone can do this, and everyone benefits.
6. Flying solo is not sustainable (like scuba diving alone is not safe). Remote team members should have a pair whom they can collaborate with; someone who understands how to work remotely or is willing to learn. Remotes can help demonstrate how.
7. Favor asynchronous communication, when synchronous dialog is needed, send a calendar invite.
8. Being inclusive of remotes is encouraging diversity. A good idea can come from anywhere and anyone, a diversity of ideas and workplace experiences strengthens culture.
9. Build a rapport with the team. During the 1st year, a remote team member should work onsite 2-4 weeks. Bond in real life.
10. Deal direct, don’t save a conversation for someday down the road. Remote collaboration does not come without challenges, keep the discussion open among team members.
11. Empathy is key, we don’t know others’ situations - so be sure to understand, use video calls (zoom) often as you need. Much of our communication is non-verbal; and can be done remotely, not just in-person. By understanding another person’s situation, we can avoid the “fundamental attribution error.”
12. Say thank you, remote team members miss the “water cooler” chatter; which is good for focus. A quick “thank you” helps recognize effort, commitment and results – it’s an easy way to make a connection. Do it with Tacos in Slack as well.
13. Be patient. “If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.” Skills are sharpened by practice.

For the occasional work from home experience (flexible schedule) not all of the above apply. Below are a few tips...

- Not every meeting needs to include video (or face-to-face) interactions. Make sure you keep communication open and timely.
For online meetings set a backup plan, perhaps the primary tool will be an online meeting and the backup may be a conference (call-in) phone number. Decide this in advance of the meeting start time
- Show up and dress for work, wherever that is. Choosing where to work affords who has the privilege of interruption. Working at home can mean that loved ones are close by; don’t shut them out, agree on a time to connect. And give them some hugs too.

Working remotely does come with some challenges and an adjustment for both onsite and remote individuals.

Perhaps one of the more difficult parts is for people who are accustomed to a realtime synchronous conversation (shoulder to shoulder). The minor audio delay in zoom meetings throws them off. Most audio/video conferencing tools have a slight audio delay. Knowing when to interject or speak up can be a challenge. A moderator can help, a visual signal can help too - 1 finger up for next, 2 fingers up for 2nd. Finding a place to meet via zoom is a hurdle for HQ desk workers. Onsite team members can help by using a good headset and overcoming hurdles of chatting via zoom while at their own desk. they're not interrupting (local) coworkers when meeting online with a (remote) coworker at their own desk.

One thing I advocate is taking breaks, a change of context can be valuable. I take a walk to get away from my laptop. Over the years, I’ve walked and talked when having tough conversations. Walking raises my heart rate, increases blood flow and causes changes in my breathing pattern, which forces me to focus and choose my words carefully.

For those with loved ones at home… the biggest adjustment is not just you working from home. The adjustment may be difficult for loved ones who’s home has been interrupted with work. If you have a door use that when you are in a meeting or need focus; otherwise, keep the door open for loved ones to come and visit with you. It’s ok to be present at home. I would listen as my kids stopped by to chat, validating their wishes. At times a pet would accompany me while I work, even in meetings. One thing I practice for my little ones… ask them what they wanted to do after lunch, so they knew I would make time for them. Being present lets them know you care. Helping your family with expectations helps them adjust to you working in the home. It’s also very rewarding, one day they may no longer be close by - enjoy the people close to you.

Regardless of working onsite or remotely, one important concept that I advocate for is... I share with my team - how to work with me. What my hours are, how best to communicate, e.g. slack, calendar invite, text/call, and my cell phone number. I tend to over-communicate as well. I’ve learned that people are not always tuned in, so it’s ok to repeat your message. But any communication that seems lengthy when typing out worth meeting face to face, rather than a chat or email.

As for tools, a good headset and microphone make a big difference when using online conferencing tools. I use Beats noise-canceling headphones and a Blue Yeti USB microphone with multiple modes. Some also use a pop filter or foam windscreen as well. This makes my audio clear, podcast quality. I also use a stand-up desk that converts my traditional desk to a standing workstation.

I think some of the biggest advantages are:
- Results-oriented focus on getting things done
- Establishing boundaries between work and life, sticking a schedule that fits your life
- Learning to be intentional about connecting with co-workers by initiating dialog other than task-oriented conversations
- Taking ownership of your health, getting up and walking, using a standup desk
- Being present both at work and at home, engaging community both online and where I live
- Ad-hoc quality time with loved ones
- Embracing asynchronous converstation, and prioritizing tasks
- Becoming a great manager of one, autonomy
- Being open and honest about effort and results
- Learning to empathize with others' situations and think the best about them

In summary, remote work is not about isolation. It is a lifestyle that prioritizes creating a great experience for everyone in your life. My opinion is that we are wired to connect with other people. Sometimes I see a face in the oddest things, especially in the design of cars. By working remotely you have the priviledge to design your community. Spending less time commuting means the freedom to accomplish more things that matter to you.
